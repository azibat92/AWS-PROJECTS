Deploying a Math Calculation Website Using AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify simplifies the process of building and deploying web applications by providing a powerful set of tools and services. Below is a step-by-step guide to deploy a math calculation website that integrates Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and IAM for permissions management.

Create Your Project with AWS Amplify

Start by setting up an Amplify project using the CLI. Run amplify init in your terminal to initialize your project.

Use the text editor to create a simple index.html file for your website. This file will contain the front-end interface for math calculations.

Setup Lambda Function

Use AWS Lambda to handle computation logic. Write your Lambda function code to perform the math calculations.

Deploy the Lambda function through the Amplify project using amplify add function. This command will package and deploy your code to AWS Lambda.

Connect API Gateway

Create an API Gateway to expose your Lambda function as a REST API.

Use amplify add api to set up a REST API that connects to the Lambda function. Amplify will automatically configure API Gateway for this integration.

Configure IAM Permissions

Use IAM to set permissions on the Lambda execution role. Ensure the role includes policies that grant access to DynamoDB and any other resources needed for the Lambda function.

Use amplify update function to configure the execution role and attach the necessary policies.

Integrate DynamoDB

Create a DynamoDB table to store data for your application (e.g., previous calculations or user inputs).

Ensure your Lambda function has the proper permissions to read/write data from the DynamoDB table.

Deploy Your Website

Deploy the website using AWS Amplify's hosting service. Run amplify publish to upload the project to an Amplify-managed hosting environment.

Amplify will provide you with a URL to access your deployed website.

Conclusion AWS Amplify, coupled with Lambda, API Gateway, IAM, and DynamoDB, offers a seamless workflow for building robust and scalable applications. By following these steps, you can easily deploy your math calculation website and leverage the power of serverless architecture.
