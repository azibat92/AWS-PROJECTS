Cloud Computing enables the on-demand access of computing services, such as servers, data storage, networking, and computing power, without requiring direct active management by the user. It allows users to rent resources from another company’s infrastructure and pay only for what they utilize.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of cloud computing solutions, combining flexibility, reliability, scalability, user-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. AWS offers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) options, making it the preferred choice for my clients.

Through my GitHub repository, I aim to showcase projects that I have successfully implemented in production environments using AWS products and services. These projects reflect my expertise as a junior Cloud Engineer and serve as a valuable reference for the future. I have designed cutting-edge architectures based on industry standards and documented configuration steps in my private notes. To ensure clarity and highlight my skills, I will present these projects concisely while safeguarding customer data by using generic names for all projects. The organization name in my examples will be RANO OIL, inspired by the district where I was born and raised, with the functional names for infrastructure appearing throughout the provisioning process.

For added simplicity, I will employ CloudFormation 1-Click deployment to automate and streamline the provisioning of infrastructure. Using templates for services or application architectures, I’ll demonstrate efficient and scalable solutions.

Ultimately, these interconnected projects will form a comprehensive system that can serve as a valuable reference for engineers during troubleshooting and implementation processes.
